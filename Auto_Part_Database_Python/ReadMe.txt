This part of the project is an extension from the previous folder "Auto Part Database". This application will use the database stored in Oracle in order to do multiple things.
  1. Pick parts for an order
  2. Move those parts to the staging area
  3. Collect the parts from the staging area to be giving to the shipper
  4. Complete the order before being shipped out.

In my code, I used a library called Pandas that allows me to connect to my Oracle database. In this part of the code, I implemented a simple program that allows the user to interact with a console. Through here, the user can do task 1-3 by using the console. It's simple, but it's purpose is to set up the code for when I'm going to build up a better GUI. There will be some bugs, but these will be fixed in the final part of my project in Auto_Part_Database_Application.

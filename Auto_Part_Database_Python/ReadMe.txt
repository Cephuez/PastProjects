This part of the project is an extension from the previous folder "Auto Part Database". This application will use the database stored in Oracle in order to do multiple things.
  1. Pick parts for an order
  2. Move those parts to the staging area
  3. Collect the parts from the staging area to be giving to the shipper
  4. Complete the order before being shipped out.

In my code, I used a library called Pandas that will allow me to connect to my Oracle database. In here, I make a simple GUI that allows the user to complete their task. 
The user will first need to log in into the server. I've created an account for myself for this part.

I've created three emplemenations so far. Reading this will give you an idea what's happening behind the scene and an idea how the demo will look like.

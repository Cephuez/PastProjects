In this part of my project, I created a database about an auto part warehouse. In here, I created tables that keeps track of the employee's information, warehouse's inventory, and customer orders. 
I coded all my code through Oracle's SQL Developer software. I used both SQL and PL/SQL to build up my database by using packages with procedures and functions stored in them. Each of these packages were attached to each table.

Hello. I'm Saul Sonido Perez, and I wanted to showcase some projects that demonstrates my skills in programming. I did several projects during my time in the University, but I still kept on developing my skills. My past projects shows my skills using C#, Java, and SQL to build up softwares. 

Lately, I have been working on making my own Oracle database using a mixture of SQL, PL/SQL, and Python. I developed my own tables, created users, coded packages, and much more to create my database using SQL Developer. In addition, I've used Pandas through Python to connect to my database. I've coded a real life application that allows a worker to pick parts in a warehouse and move them to their assigned location.

For my Android project, I could only add in my script files because adding the whole project into
github was too big. 

My android projects were all coded through Android Studio. 
I added two projects that utilized the app's capability the most. For example, using an API from a website, 
using camera, touch controls, and other features.

I added the files through DropBox and you can click the link under here if you would like to run the program through Android Studio

I provided further explanation in each of the folders.

1_Auto_Part_Database
- This is where I created my auto part database. 

2_Auto_Part_Python
- Here, I coded a way to allow the user to do specific tasks through command prompts.

3_Auto_Part_Application
- This combines the previous folders into one. I allow the user to interact with a simple gui
- It's suppose to simulate a worker completing their task during work.

Hello. I'm Saul Sonido Perez, and I wanted to showcase some projects that demonstrates my skills in programming. I've done different projects in the past. I've worked
with Android app development through Android Studio, coded an SQL server through Oracle, simulated a CPU by storing memory in virtual space, and programmed two video 
game prototypes through Unity Engine. I worked with different computer language such as Java with Android and SQL, C with the CPU simulation, C# with Unity Engine, and HTML/CSS on programming my own website.

I have provided some readme.txt on each folder that can guide you on what was focused on each project with some coding scripts. For some of the projects, I have provided some direct downloads through Dropbox if you would like to look more closely.

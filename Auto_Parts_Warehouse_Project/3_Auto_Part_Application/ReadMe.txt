This is the final part of my Auto Part Warehouse Database project. I combine all of my code written in Auto_Part_Database and Auto_Part_Python. 
In here, I will simulate the point of view of worker collecting the parts for a worker. They will use an application that will allow them to 
move parts from their shelves to their final locations. If you want more in depth explanation of how all my code was written, look at my Auto_Part_Database 
and Auto_Part_Python folders.

I will provide a pdf file attached to the demo. I will try to add additional details with timestamp throughout the demo.

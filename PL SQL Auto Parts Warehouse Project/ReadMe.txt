This has been my most recent project. I've practiced my skills in both SQL and PL/SQL by creating my own tables, and writing procedures for each one. 
I created my own database for a warehouse of car parts, that keeps track of employees, car parts, and orders. Similar to Amazon, I wrote procedures
that handle orders, looks for these parts, and finalize them at the end. I've provided some images of my tables plus the code used for this project. 
I provided a full export of my project if you desire to see all of my code more precisely.

Note: 01/17 Adding more information about my project over time.

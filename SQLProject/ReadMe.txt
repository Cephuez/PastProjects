For this project, I have added two different view points of my project. Both projects uses Oracle to store the
information about the pets being set for adoption. The only difference is that one is runned through a website,
while the other one prompts the user by typing into console. 

Navigating through ProjectLayout -> WEB-INF -> classes, will let you see the code that I wrote to set up the 
website. They are divided into classes, so it's easier to see what classes focused on what.

Clicking 'petadopt' will let you see the code for prompting the user with console. They are all written in
one class, but the methods are divided into specific roles they had in the project.

I worked on two game projects through Unity Engine. First being Mysterious Forest and NAPR.

Since the files are too big to link the whole project, I've only added the code scripts used for the projects. By clicking any of the .c files, it will show you
the code of each game.

I used most of the Unity libraries to code in the game. This allowed me to program the physics, animation, inventory, and detect any nearby objects. I've organized 
my code in a matter that may interest you. Everything is coded in C#.

The purpose of this application is to allow the worker to sign in into their devices to complete their tasks. That means providing
a simple promp request that will tell each worker what they want to do. From there the worker will decide what they want to do
like picking parts, staging parts, or gather parts to process an order.

Most of my code is written in "Input_Command.py". Each implementation specifies what functions were used.

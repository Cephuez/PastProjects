For this part, I'll be using Python and and Pandas, a data analysis library, that will allow me to interact with my database from Oracle. 
Ths goal is to program an application that allows the user to interact with the database by inputting information as if they are working.
I will use my previous implementation to allow the worker to
  1. Log in into their account
  2. Move products around the warehouse
  3. Processing orders by picking them from the shelf
  4. Completing the order once all the parts are collected.

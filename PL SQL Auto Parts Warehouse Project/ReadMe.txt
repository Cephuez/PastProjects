This has been my most recent project. I've practiced my skills in both SQL and PL/SQL by creating my own tables, and writing procedures for each one. 
I created my own database for a warehouse of car parts, that keeps track of employees, car parts, and orders. All the implementations I've provided is suppose to mimic 
what workers will do in a normal environment. For example, moving parts around the warehouse, collecting items for an order, adding parts from purchase orders to the
warehouse, and more.

I've provided folders where some contain information of implementations while other references my tables, views, etc
